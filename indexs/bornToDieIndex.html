                Feet don't fail me now
                Take me to the finish line
                Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take
                But I'm hoping at the gates
                They'll tell me that you're mine

                Walking through the city streets
                Is it by mistake or desire?
                I feel so alone on a Friday night
                Can you make it feel like home
                If I tell you you're mine

                It's like I told you honey

                Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
                Sometimes love is not enough
                And the road gets tough
                I don't know why
                Keep making me laugh,
                Let's go get high
                The road is long, we carry on
                Try to have fun in the meantime

                Come and take a walk on the wild side
                Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
                You like your girls insane
                Choose your last words
                This is the last time
                Cause you and I

                We were born to die

                Lost but now I am found
                I can see but once I was blind
                I was so confused as a little child
                Tried to take what I could get
                Scared that I couldn't find
                All the answers honey

                Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
                Sometimes love is not enough
                And the road gets tough
                I don't know why
                Keep making me laugh
                Let's go get high
                The road's long, we carry on
                Try to have fun in the meantime
